# ✅ Deployment Fix Applied

## What Was Done

1. **Pushed Full Code to GitHub**: Replaced the old bootstrap code with your complete, feature-rich application
2. **Repository Updated**: Your GitHub repo now has all 7 levels, features, and improvements

## Your Repository

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/joshuaLwilliams01/Ethics-Tech-Policy-Sandbox
- **Status**: ✅ Code is up to date
- **Ready for Deployment**: ✅ Yes

## Next Steps - Deploy on Vercel

### Option 1: Re-deploy on Vercel (Easiest)

Since your code is now on GitHub:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project: `Ethics-Tech-Policy-Sandbox`
3. Click **"Redeploy"** or go to **Settings → Deployments**
4. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
5. Or trigger a new deployment by pushing any small change

### Option 2: Re-import Project

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Select your repository: `joshuaLwilliams01/Ethics-Tech-Policy-Sandbox`
4. Vercel will detect:
   - Framework: **Next.js** ✅
   - Build Command: `npm run build` ✅
   - Output Directory: `.next` ✅
5. Click **"Deploy"**

## What's Different Now

### Old Bootstrap Code (What Was in GitHub):
- ❌ Only 1 level with 1 scenario
- ❌ Basic components
- ❌ Missing features
- ❌ Outdated structure

### New Complete Code (Now in GitHub):
- ✅ All 7 levels with 35 scenarios
- ✅ Individualized progress tracking
- ✅ Certificate generation
- ✅ Social sharing
- ✅ Audio toggle
- ✅ Continue Journey feature
- ✅ Test progress page
- ✅ Completion page
- ✅ All features and improvements

## Verification

Before deploying, verify:
- ✅ Build passes: `npm run build`
- ✅ Content validated: All 7 levels (35 scenarios)
- ✅ Configuration: `vercel.json` present
- ✅ All files pushed to GitHub

## If Deployment Still Fails

Check the Vercel build logs for:
1. Build errors
2. Missing dependencies
3. TypeScript errors
4. Missing files

Common fixes:
- Make sure `package.json` has all dependencies
- Verify `vercel.json` is correct
- Check that all level JSON files are committed

Your code is now ready! 🚀
